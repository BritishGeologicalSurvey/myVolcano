# myVolcano
myVolcano is a citizen science app that enables you to share your observations of natural hazards. Upload photos or descriptions of what you've seen, felt, heard or smelt so they can be shared with the myVolcano community. myVolcano also shows you how to collect distal volcanic ash samples, such as from the eruptions in Iceland in 2010 and 2011 which produced widespread ash fall across the UK and Europe. These samples can help scientists gather vital new information about volcanic eruptions. Discover the volcanoes of the world from the Smithsonian Institution and find out who monitors volcanoes and geohazards around the world in our new home region pages.
